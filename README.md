# Wikitrends_package
This code (not yet a clean package) allows to retrive the number of wikipedia (English) reverts per day. The job_submitter.py code allows to submit multiple LSF jobs to do several days in parallel. the file Wiki_trends_analysis.R allows to visualise weekly pattern for specific artilces and output a table of articles with the highest number of reverts in total.
